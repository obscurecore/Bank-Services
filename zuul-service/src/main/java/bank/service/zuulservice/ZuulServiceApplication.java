/**
 * Zuul - proxy, gateway between user and services
 * need to handle outside request and routing to the desired internal infrastructure services
 *
 * It start with launch pre-filters, pass request using Netty and then return response after launch post-filters
 *
 * Filters are the basis of functionality.They can be performed in different parts of the lifecycle(req-res)
 * 		cause they bear responsibility for the application's business logic
 *
 * 	pre-filter:
 * 	 Performed before routing and can be used for authentication, routing and req processing, speed limit, security from DDoS
 * 	endpoint-filter:
 *   bear for req processing
 *  post-filter:
 *   running after handle response from source and can be used for metric or amend answer
 *  error-filter:
 *   when the error occurs, during on of the other stages
 *
 *
 *  So with this approach user can communicate with gallery-service not through (http://localhost:8081)
 *  	 and directly through zuul itself. this way(http://localhost:8766/gallery) or to gallery-service
 *  	 (http://localhost:8766/users)
 *
 *  	 services don't know about each other and don't know anything about zuul. lowest coupling
 *  	 only need know the service name
